# LaMarzoccoTempSensor
Temperature Sensor for the LMHome Mini

This project uses the Thermistor in the La Marzocco Home Mini (Linea Mini) to read the temperature of the brew boiler.
The code is uploaded to and Arduino Nano or similar and read on the analogRead Pin. The temperature is then read out on a 4 digit display however this part of the project isn't stricly neccessary
